# Hello-World
This repository is for learning how GitHub works. My first repository.
This file was created on the 13th Jul 2024, five days after the commencement of the second semester. It is a weekend (Saturday) and I'm in my room with the heater on, feeling strongly ambitious, motivated and eager to learn more stuff about the developer world.
It's overwhelming most of the time. There's always new things to learn and looking at a bunch of paragraphs explaining some concept or topic get me lazy from just looking at it, but I have this burning desire of being a brilliant software developer. I feel it's going to take me time to reach a level where I'm super confidence about my skills.
I'm currently doing my final year in IT @NWU, Vanderbijlpark. I'm constantly praying to God to help me be disciplined and grow my love for coding and all that comes with it, the challanges, the overwhelming amount of resources to read, watch demonstrations or listen to.
I LOVE CODING, I'M NOT YET CONFIDENT ABOUT MY SKILLS, BUT I KNOW I'M GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BEST IN THIS FIELD. I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES!!
I'M A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER FOR LIFE!
